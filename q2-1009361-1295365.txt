First thing, when looking at the data and the way the label is encoded, we have 0 for neutral, 1 for against and 2 for support. 
This is not a very well encoded. While the neutral level is encoded correctly,
the against label is encoded as a 1. Since neutral is between against and support, an encode as follows would be better:
-1 for against, 
0 for neutral
 and 1 for support, 
or:
0 for against, 
1 for neutral and
1 for support.
A limitation of the implementation is that the class/function only tokenizes the input data. 
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a string of text into individual words or tokens,
but it does not necessarily capture the context or relationships between those tokens.
This may affect downstream performance because some models, such as those based on word embeddings, 
rely on the context and relationships between words to accurately represent the meaning of the text.

The normalized method only handles hashtags and numbers and does not address other types of noise
or inconsistencies in the data, such as misspellings. This may reduce the effectiveness of the function.
  
Suppose the Vectorizer class is used in a pipeline for feature representation without additional preprocessing 
or feature engineering steps. 
In that case, the resulting vectors may not capture important information about the context or relationships between words. 
This could negatively impact classification accuracy.
Lack of normalization or scaling of the final feature vectors may result in features with different ranges or distributions having 
a disproportionate influence on the classification model, leading to poor performance.
